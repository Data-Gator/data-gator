VWC  is a measurement which is derived from the voltage represented in the VWC Raw field. Depth is the relative depth at which the sensor was burried.                                                                                                                                                                            |

BATT_VOLTAGE is a measurement of the battery voltage of the battery connected to the datagator. Firmware version is the version/support capability indicator and can be used to look up what sensors are compatible with this device.                                                                                             |

Page size and topic filter have default values but can be changed. | { | PAGE_SIZE=50 | TIME_RANGE   | TOPIC_FILTER=""  |         | } |   | Default page size is the number of timestamped entries to pull from a file before publishing with MQTT. Topic filter is a white list filter, where "" matches everything. Otherwise only entries whose topic starts with a topic filter entry will be accepted. Time range should be of the form "<timestamp>-<timestamp>" where only data collected between the two timestamps is returned. |
