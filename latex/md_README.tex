Aggregator firmware for Project Vine\+Heart as a Platform\+IO project. Doxygen documentation \href{html/index.html}{\texttt{ here}}.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md19}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Compiling and Uploading}{Compiling and Uploading}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md19}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item To build and upload the current code to the board without modifying\+:

pio run -\/t upload // OR open serial monitor afterward pio run -\/t upload -\/t monitor
\item To generate {\ttfamily include/config.\+h} with selected network parameters\+:

pio run -\/e config-\/firebeetle32
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md20}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Unit Tests}{Unit Tests}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md20}
Unit tests have been added to allow verification of firmware and hardware functionality. To use unit tests, connect the aggregator board to your laptop via USB and run the following command from the root of this directory\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}pio test
\end{DoxyVerb}
 This will run {\bfseries{all}} unit tests on the board and print the results to the terminal sans debug messages. To see more debug information run with option {\ttfamily -\/v}, {\ttfamily -\/vv}, or {\ttfamily -\/vvv} depending on how much information you need.

Finally, if you only want to run a specific test use the following commands\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}# to see list of available tests
pio test --list-tests

# to run desired test 
pio test -f <test_name>
\end{DoxyVerb}
 \doxysubparagraph*{NOTE}

Aggregators collect sensor data from a variety of \doxylink{src_2main_8cpp_a2df27a00b191de3537c3b53adcecf1e8}{sensors(wired and wireless)} and publish the data via MQTT messages to a broker. The aggregators have been dubbed the "{}\+Data Gators"{}. A example of the aggregator/\+Data Gator hardware is shown below\+:
