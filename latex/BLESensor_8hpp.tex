\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file implements BLE Sensor generic interface. 

\doxylink{classBLESensor}{BLESensor} is the parent class for all bluetooth low energy sensors which are currently implemented for the Data Gator firmware architecture.

At this time (Fall 2023), only temperature and humidity sensors are supported, but it is possible that other types could be supported, requiring the parameters passed to to\+JSON(..) to change.
