# Project Description
This is the documentation for the Data Gator firmware. It may be used as a detailed reference for extending and 
improving firmware for the system. 

When reading this documentation, note that there is documentation both for maintainers and those who want to extend the functionality of the system without re-writing the basic functions. If you are the later, look for these keys which indicate documentation specifically for adding new sensors, etc:

- header files (`*.hpp`) which have a documentation section labeled `Integration`
